# To run the nrtg feature follow this steps

1. Start an activemq broker on localhost

  There are two options for this:

  a. download the apache activemq distribution and run it (bin/activemq console)

  b. start one inside the opennms osgi container by running the
     following commands:

     features:install activemq-blueprint
     activemq:create-broker -t blueprint

2. Install the nrtg feature in the opennms osgi container

  You may start this feature by running

  features:install nrtg

  alternatively you may install the individual features for nrtg

  features:install osgi-nrtg-api osgi-nrtg-nrtcollector osgi-nrtg-protocolcollector-snmp

3. Install NRTG Web components
  - Provide the org.opennms.features.nrtg/nrtg-web/1.11.3-SNAPSHOT to the local .m2/repository 
    or to the opennms/system folder in the same structure like in .m2/repository
  - The nrtg servlet sample can be installed by doing the following:

    bundle:install mvn:org.apache.activemq/activemq-web/5.6.0
    bundle:install mvn:org.opennms.features.nrtg/nrtg-web/1.11.3-SNAPSHOT
